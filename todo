## boss 1 design
DONE add "dead-end" flag to rooms. Dead ends can be picked for use as special rooms (e.g. Boss, Shop, Item, Upgrade, etc)
DONE add boss room, which has no walls and collision at 0,0,127,127
DONE add boss-room-entering animation - dither fades to white, dither fades back with player on bottom third, boss on top third.
DONE boss stage 1: shoots simple cluster projectiles towards player
DONE boss stage 2: fires rotating multi clusters at her position, with a slowly increasing radius and a scaled rotation speed. the rotation speed is angular, not linear, so the actual linear speed scales at a rate of 2pi with respect to the radius, so we need to set it to radius/2pi
DONE boss stage 3: both 1 and 2 at the same time, at slightly faster rates. boss moves a bit faster too.
TODO funny explosion when boss dies :3
