TODO boss stage 1: shoots simple cluster projectiles towards player
TODO boss stage 2: fires rotating multi clusters at her position, with a slowly increasing radius and a scaled rotation speed. the rotation speed is angular, not linear, so the actual linear speed scales at a rate of 2pi with respect to the radius, so we need to set it to radius/2pi
