DONE add boss room, which has no walls and collision at 0,0,127,127
DONE add boss-room-entering animation - dither fades to white, dither fades back with player on bottom third, boss on top third.
DONE boss stage 1: shoots simple cluster projectiles towards player
DONE boss stage 2: fires rotating multi clusters at her position, with a slowly increasing radius and a scaled rotation speed. the rotation speed is angular, not linear, so the actual linear speed scales at a rate of 2pi with respect to the radius, so we need to set it to radius/2pi
DONE boss stage 3: both 1 and 2 at the same time, at slightly faster rates. boss moves a bit faster too.
TODO funny explosion when boss dies :3
